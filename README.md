# VulnerabilityDataset
This repository is a dataset of vulnerability datasets. In the excel-file titled "Main_DataSet", the record number of 15181 rows extracted from source-code of six real projects (OpenSSL, SQLite, libxslt, FreeType, LibTiff, and Binutils) is prepared at the function level.
Also, the attack type of each function (each row) is also specified. Each row represents information related to one function of the program. The rest of the files are 8 datasets that are produced in a balanced format (vulnerable / non-vulnerable) from the "Main_DataSet" used for the machine learning model.
