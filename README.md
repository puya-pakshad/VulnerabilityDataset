# VulnerabilityDataset
This is a repository of datasets used to detect security vulnerabilities and types of vulnerabilities at the function level. In the excel-file titled "Main_DataSet", the record number of 15181 rows extracted from source-code of six real projects (OpenSSL, SQLite, libxslt, FreeType, LibTiff, and Binutils) is prepared at the function level. Overally, This dataset includes 49,599 records, each of which specifies the information of a function of 10 projects. Moreover, there are 275 vulnerable functions in this dataset. So Out Vulnerability dataset1 of source code extracted from 10 real projects (OpenSSL, SQLite, FreeType, LibTiff, Libxslt, Binutils, FFmpeg, ImageMagick, OpenSC, and rdesktop) was prepared for the first time that can be
used publicly by security experts for further studies.
Also, the attack type of each function (each row) is also specified. Each row represents information related to one function of the program. The rest of the files are 8 datasets that are produced in a balanced format (vulnerable / non-vulnerable) from the "Main_DataSet" used for the machine learning model.

# Some pseudo-code snippets to calculate security metrics

M1 - Cyclomatic metrics:

```
queryNodeIndex("functionId:(id1 id2 idN) AND isCFGNode:True").as("x").outE("FLOWS_TO").id.as("y").select{it.functionId}{it}.groupBy{it[0]}{it[1]}{it.size()}.cap
queryNodeIndex("functionId:(id1 id2 idN) AND isCFGNode:True").functionId.groupCount().cap
```

M2:
```
KI
